## About This Course

**FYS5419** explores the revolutionary paradigm where **superposition**, **entanglement**, and **quantum interference** unlock computational possibilities beyond classical limits. From simulating complex many-body quantum systems to implementing machine learning on quantum hardware — this is where physics meets the future.

### What You'll Find Here

| Project | Focus Area | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Project 1** | Quantum Circuits & Algorithms | In Progress |
| **Project 2** | Quantum Machine Learning | Upcoming |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, I aim to:

- Design and implement **quantum circuits** for many-particle systems
- Run algorithms on **real quantum computers**
- Understand **quantum vs classical** performance tradeoffs
- Master **quantum noise** and its implications
- Apply **QML algorithms** to classical and quantum datasets

## Why Quantum Computing Matters

Classical computers have limits. For problems in **cryptography**, **drug discovery**, **optimization**, and **quantum simulation** — quantum computers offer an exponential edge. This isn't just theoretical; it's the next industrial revolution.

> *"Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical."*
